## Program Function
Our program relays out an ask for the user to watch a movie together. 
The first two lines of code take in input. Specifically, the first will ask for the name of the user with the variable storage called "name". After the user has complied, the next ask will be what their favorite movie is with the variable storage called "favMovie". The last line relays out a print of "Hey (name), do you want to watch a movie together?" 

Example of input code: 
name = input("What is your name? ")
